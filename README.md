# <b>Learning Project:</b> Chess webapp

<h2>December 12th, 2020</h2>
Restarting project with new knowledge and skills from semester. Still planning to avoid using any libraries. Will use cleaner Javascript and better UI, hopefully leading to a finished Chess webapp.

Stopping project here. Code became too complex to easily add changes and this project served its purpose with teaching me syntax and Javascript-specific nuances. I'd like to rewrite this code after I take a course in Javascript next semester.
