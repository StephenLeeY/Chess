# <b>Learning Project:</b> Chess webapp

<h2>December 25th, 2020</h2>
Finished base game, which I was unable to do before due to very messy code. There are likely going to be small bugs which should be trivial to fix once found. Getting started on implementing a very basic, dumb AI first. A smarter AI will depend on how costly a simulation is for this Chess implementation.

Restarting project with new knowledge and skills from semester. Still planning to avoid using any libraries. Will use cleaner Javascript and better UI, hopefully leading to a finished Chess webapp.

<h2>August 5th, 2020</h2>
Stopping project here. Code became too complex to easily add changes and this project served its purpose with teaching me syntax and Javascript-specific nuances. I'd like to rewrite this code after I take a course in Javascript next semester.
