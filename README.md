# Chess
Creating Chess webapp in purely JS for learning purposes

Stopping project here on August 5th, 2020. Code became too complex to easily add changes and this project served its purpose with teaching me syntax and Javascript-specific nuances. I'd like to rewrite this code after I take a course in Javascript next semester.
